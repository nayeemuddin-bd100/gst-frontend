### Changing the Logo (Header & Footer)

There are **two ways** to update the logo:

#### Option 1: Replace Logo File (Recommended)
1. Open the project source files.
2. Navigate to the `public/` folder.
3. Place your new logo image **next to the old logo file**.
4. **Delete** the old logo.
5. **Rename** the new logo file to the **same name** as the old logo.
6. Save and deploy.

> This method avoids needing to change any paths in the dashboard.

#### Option 2: Update Path Manually
1. Go to the **Dashboard → Edit Pages → Header** section.
2. Find the logo image path field.
3. Change the logo file name/path to match your new logo.
4. Save changes.
